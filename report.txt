I. Axis-Wise Results (Single-Axis Performance)

Axis	Control Task	Result	Best Algorithm	Remarks
Roll	Hover disturbance rejection	PINDI significantly lowest (4.06 vs 11.4 / 20.2 / 18.8)	PINDI	Lowest RMS error, statistically significant (p = 8.7e−74)
Pitch	Hover disturbance rejection	PINDI significantly lowest (4.09 vs 11.2 / 19.3 / 20.6)	PINDI	Lowest RMS error, statistically significant (p = 5.3e−73)
Yaw	Active tracking	INDI+INV lowest (36.0 vs 39.1 / 39.5 / 42.0)	INDI+INV	Lowest RMS error, statistically significant (p = 7.4e−70)

Conclusion:
	•	In hover disturbance rejection (Roll and Pitch), PINDI clearly outperforms the other methods;
	•	In active tracking (Yaw), INDI+INV achieves the best performance.

➡️ No single algorithm is optimal across all axes simultaneously.

II. Three-Axis Composite Metrics

Metric	Definition	Best Algorithm	Interpretation
Arithmetic Mean	Average error across three axes (mean accuracy)	PINDI	Lowest overall mean error
RMS Fusion	Combined RMS energy across three axes (system energy stability)	INDI+INV	Slightly lower total energy and smoother response

Interpretation:
	•	From an average accuracy perspective, PINDI is optimal;
	•	From a total error energy and system stability perspective, INDI+INV performs slightly better.

III. Error Energy Contribution (Source Analysis)

Algorithm	Roll	Pitch	Yaw	Dominant Characteristic
INDI+INV	0.085	0.081	0.834	Energy concentrated in yaw (active control axis)
INDI+WLS	0.180	0.165	0.655	More balanced across axes
INDI+DIR	0.155	0.184	0.661	More balanced across axes
PINDI	0.009	0.010	0.981	Almost all energy concentrated in yaw

Observations:
	•	With PINDI, disturbance energy in Roll and Pitch is almost completely suppressed (<1%);
	•	However, yaw error accounts for 98% of total energy, indicating concentration in the actively controlled axis.

IV. Normalized Results (Scale-Invariant Comparison)

Normalized Mean	PINDI	Best average accuracy
Normalized RMS	INDI+INV (slightly lower)	More stable energy distribution

V. Overall Assessment (Final Evaluation)

Evaluation Aspect	Best Algorithm	Technical Basis
Roll disturbance rejection	PINDI	Lowest RMS with strong statistical significance
Pitch disturbance rejection	PINDI	Lowest RMS with strong statistical significance
Yaw tracking	INDI+INV	Lowest RMS with strong statistical significance
Average error (Arithmetic mean)	PINDI	Lowest overall mean error
Energy stability (RMS fusion)	INDI+INV	Lowest total error energy

VI. Concluding Statement (Formal Technical Expression)

Based on statistical analysis, PINDI demonstrates superior performance in the roll and pitch channels, achieving the lowest RMS errors and the highest overall accuracy.
However, in the yaw channel, which corresponds to an active tracking task, INDI+INV exhibits significantly lower RMS error and improved energy stability.

Therefore:
	•	From the perspective of average accuracy, PINDI can be regarded as the optimal solution;
	•	From the perspective of system energy and dynamic stability, INDI+INV shows superior performance.

Conclusion:
It is not appropriate to claim that “PINDI is universally optimal.”
Its superiority holds under hover disturbance rejection and average accuracy metrics, but not under all control objectives.

⸻

Summary

PINDI achieves significantly improved disturbance rejection and average accuracy in hover conditions, while INDI+INV provides lower error and better stability in active yaw tracking.
Overall system performance therefore exhibits dimension-dependent optimality, rather than a single control algorithm being dominant in all aspects.
